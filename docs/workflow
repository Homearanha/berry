** This is the workflow for the berry suite of programs **

1) First an scf calculation has to be done with the dft software (we will use Quantum ESPRESSO for now)
 - in the working directory, one needs to create a directory called 'dft' and copy to that directory the QE input file for an scf calculation and the pseudopotentials files.

 - An input file for the berry run has to be created in the running directory with several parameters defined.
	minimum parameters:
		origin of k-points
		number of k-points in each direction
		step of the k-points
		number of bands

 - with this data, the program should prepare and run an nscf calculation, departing from the scf calculation done previously.

 - After running nscf calculation, the program should read the main output file to gather data from the calculation that will be used latter, and should save it to a specific, formated files.
	Data needed to gather and save:
		*lattice dimensions
		*reciprocal lattice dimensions
		lattice vectors
		reciprocal lattice vectors
		ordered eigenvalues
		ordered list of k-points
		ordered list of occupations
		*ordered list of real space points
		total number of k-points
		number of k-points in each direction
		total number of real space points
		number of real space points in each direction

- Generates and saves:
		list of neighbors of each k-point (which neighbors to consider may be an input parameter)
		for each (k,r) the phase factor of the Bloch functions
	This finishes the preparatory phase.

- Make wavefunctions coherent:
	read wavefunctions in real space
	choose a low symmetry point in real space and apply a phase to all wave functions so that the phase in that point is set to zero
	save all wavefunctions


2) Calculate the dot product of each wavefunction of a k-point with each wavefunction of the neighboring k-points.
