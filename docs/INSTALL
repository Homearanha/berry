This file explains the steps to install the BERRY suite in a linux computer

Requirements:
- Assuming a Quantum Espresso working instalation has been done, and that it is in the PATH.
- A fortran compiler has to be installed
- This software uses python3 with the following libraries, that have to be installed:
	numpy
	sys
	time
	joblib
	math
	os
	findiff
	ast
	matplotlib.pyplot
	mpl_toolkits.mplot3d
	xml.etree.ElementTree
(most of these should already be there by default)

Instalation:
- The github packages should be downloaded from
 https://github.com/ricardoribeiro-2020/berry/archive/master.zip
unziped in the directory where the instalation is to be done and the directory structure kept.
A directory called bin should be created, where the binaries of the fortran compilation should go.

- In the directory src there are three programs in fortran that have to be compiled.
One is using a normal compilation, for instance, if you have gfortran:

 gfortran -O3 -o extractwfc.x extractwfc.f90

will create the file extractwfc.x that has to be moved to directory bin.
The other two are compiled as a python library, so the commands are

 py -m numpy.f2py -c connections.f90 -m connections
 py -m numpy.f2py -c interpolation.f90 -m interpolat

and the resulting files should be moved to the directory python.

- One last thing is to add the system variable $BERRYPATH:

 export BERRYPATH="/home/ricardo/Dropbox/research/programs/berry/"

This should be included in the file .bashrc so that the variable is kept everytime a shell is run.
With this last step, each python script of the suite should run, giving the full path to the script.

Preparing for running:
- To run, first one has to create a directory where the results will be, and inside it create a directory called dft.
Inside dft should go the pseudopotential files for the atomic species of the dft calculation and the file scf.in with the details of the scf run.
This scf.in file has to be a Quantum Espresso scf run file; this is the only one implemented.
It is important to include the line with the command nbnd in the SYSTEM tag.
Also, 
 pseudo_dir = './dft/' ,
 outdir = './dft/out/' ,

- Another thing is to create in the direcotry where the run will be performed a file input as described in the file workflow.

- All the scripts should be run from this directory, including full path to the script.
