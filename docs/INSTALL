This file explains the steps to install the BERRY suite in a linux computer

Requirements:
- Assuming a Quantum Espresso working instalation has been done, and that it is in the PATH.

- This software uses python3 with the following libraries, that have to be installed:
	numpy
	sys
	time
	joblib
	math
	os
	findiff
	ast
	matplotlib.pyplot
	mpl_toolkits.mplot3d
	xml.etree.ElementTree
(most of these should already be there by default)

Instalation:

- The github packages should be downloaded from
 https://github.com/ricardoribeiro-2020/berry/archive/master.zip
unziped in the directory where the instalation is to be done and the directory structure kept.

With this, each python script of the suite should run, giving the full path to the script.

Preparing for running:

- To run, first one has to create a directory where the results will be, and inside it create a directory called dft.

- Inside dft should go the pseudopotential files for the atomic species of the dft calculation and the file scf.in with the details of the scf run.
 This scf.in file has to be a Quantum Espresso scf run file; this is the only one implemented so far.

- It is important to include the line with the command nbnd in the SYSTEM tag of the scf.in file.
 And also, 
  pseudo_dir = './dft/' ,
  outdir = './dft/out/' ,

- Create a file input (as described in the file workflow) in the directory where the run will be performed.

- All the scripts should be run from this directory, including the full path to the python scripts.
