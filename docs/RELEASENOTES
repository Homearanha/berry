RELEASE NOTES for berry v.1.0

New in 1.0 version:

This version is the first release for production, and it has many changes relative to previous ones.
Therefore, the input and output of most programs may not be compatible with older versions.

The main differences in this version are:

- Implementation of a machine learning algorithm to improve the selection of the bands.

- Paralelization of most the code, which resulted in a large decrease in wall clock running time.

- Code more conformed with PEP8 and usual practices.
